# NumerosityExperiment
Psychophysics experiment in jspsych

## Quick summary:
Participants are shown two images side-by-side and are asked to (1) report which image contains more items (gabor patches) and (2) how confident they feel in their selection. 
## 1. Background
Research on metacognitive judgements has shown that a larger amount of evidence supporting one’s choice leads to higher confidence judgements. Importantly, these findings are independent of the disconfirmatory evidence presented. One such study (Samaha et al., 2016) investigated this effect using noisy grating stimuli by varying the amount of positive evidence available. They demonstrated that perceptual confidence depended on the amount of positive evidence, while accuracy depended on the ratio of positive to negative evidence. Another study (Rhodes and Castel, 2008) demonstrated that participants tend to report higher judgments of learning (another measure of metacognition) of words when the font size is larger, but their accuracy is not affected by font size at all. This illusion is so strong that even when explicitly told font size has no effect on learning, participants still show a cognitive bias, though to a lesser extent. These and other studies (Maniscalco et al., 2016; Koizumi et al., 2015; Zylberberg et al., 2012) have shown that a larger amount of evidence in favor of one’s decision drives higher confidence ratings. 

## 2. Stimuli and Task 
For this project, I use a visual illusion in which more coherently oriented groups of objects appear more numerous than those that are variably oriented (DeWind et al., 2020). When creating the stimuli, I draw orientations with three levels of coherence and seven numerosities. The participants are presented stimuli in pairs for 750 ms each and  choose which side is more (or less) numerous. After each decision, they’ll be asked to rate their confidence on a scale of 1-100. 

## 3. Hypothesis 
Given the impressive amount of research showing that large amounts of positive evidence lead to higher confidence levels, I expect that even stimuli that appear to have more positive evidence (appear to be more numerous) will yield higher confidence ratings. I’ll evaluate this by comparing the confidence ratings for stimulus pairs with high and medium coherence to pairs with medium and low coherence. 

## 4. Expected Results
First, I expect that the actual numerosity ratio will dominate one’s confidence levels - if the number of objects in both stimulus sets in a pair are exactly the same, confidence will be generally lower than when one side has considerably more objects than the other. Second, within these ratio pairings, I would expect to see a difference between high coherence pairings and low coherence pairings. High coherence pairings will likely yield higher confidence because the objects appear more numerous than they actually are.
